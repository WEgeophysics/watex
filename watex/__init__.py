"""
ðŸ’§ Machine Learning Research Module for Hydrogeophysic 
======================================================

Originally called **WAT-er EX-ploration using AI learning methods*, `WATex`_ is
an open-source package entirely written in Python to bring a piece of solution 
in the field of groundwater exploration (GWE) via the use of ML learning methods. 
Currently, it deals with the geophysical methods (Electrical and Electromagnetic
methods). And, Modules and packages are written to solve real-engineering 
problems in the field of GWE. Later, it expects to add other methods such as the
induced polarisation and the near surface refraction-seismic for environmental
purposes (especially, for cavities detection to preserve the productive aquifers) 
as well as including pure Hydrogeology methods.
