v0.3.1 (December 22, 2023)
--------------------------

These are substantial changes in ``v0.2.7`` API that lead to new features and fugs fixed. 
 
- |API change| The parameter ``edi_obj`` in :func:`watex.utils.plot_skew` is deprecated. It is replaced by ``edis__list`` which indicate a collection 
  of :term:`EDI` files or a full path to EDI-files. Two-dimensional skewness :math:`eta` can also be visualized by turning the parameter ``view='2D'``.  

- |API change|  ``Xgboot`` library is no longer available as dependencies during the library installation. To install it as a dependency, use the ``dev`` option as : 

  .. code-block:: bash 

    pip install watex[dev] 

- |Fix| :class:`watex.em.EM` module raises :class:`watex.exceptions.EDIError` rather than ``AttributeError`` when EDI-file is expected while object is passed. 

- |Feature| :func:`watex.utils.plotutils.plot_l_curve` plots the Hansen L-curve with an option to highlight the Hansen point. Indeed, the L-curve criteria is used to determine the suitable model 
  after runing multiple inversions with different :math:`\tau` values.
