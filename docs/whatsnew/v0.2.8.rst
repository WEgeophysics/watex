v0.2.8 (December 12, 2023)
--------------------------

These are minor changes  in ``v0.2.7`` that shows fugs fixed.  


- |Fix| Bug in removing the static shift in :term:`AMT` data. Henceforth the correction factor method :meth:`watex.methods.em.ZC.get_ss_correction_factor`
  is applied for each station differently rather than using the factor to correct all stations. There are also a  choice for user to input the correction factors
   ``ss_fx`` and ``ss_fy`` manually into a list. 

- |Feature| :func:`watex.utils.plotutils.plot_tensors` plots resistivity and phase tensors or the real and imaginary impedance.

- |Feature| :func:`watex.utils.torres_verdin_filter` calculates the adaptive moving average of a given data array from 
  Torres and Verdin codes 

- |Feature| :func:`watex.methods.em.filtered_noises` remove noise from single component ``xx``, ``yy``, ``xy`` or ``yx``. 

- |Feature| :meth:`watex.methods.em.ZC.remove_noises` removes indesired and artifacts in the data and smooth it. 

- |Enhancement| :func:`watex.utils.read_data` is now able to read data in `txt` and numpy  formats (`.npy` and `.npz`). 

- |Enhancement| :func:`watex.view.TPlot.plot_rhophi` changes the style of plot in preceeding versions. It accepts parameter `kind` for plotting multiple stations differently.
