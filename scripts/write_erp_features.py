.. synopsis:: compute geelectrical features `sfi`, `magnitude`,
             power` ``shape` and `type`  from ERP survey lines. 
             If shape and type are notgiven on the excel worksheet , 
             will compute automatically.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
How to arrange your sheet before calling  erp collection module. 
    refered as :mod:`watex.core.erp.ERP_collection` ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    Suppose an ERP survey performed in `zzegbao1_2`  location . 
    The excel whorkbook will probably called ` `zzegbao1_2.xlsx`
    or `zzegbao1_2.csv`. 
    This is how must be arrange data into the worksheet:
        
       Headers with `*` means compulsory data and others are optional  data. 
       `x`  and `y` are  utm easting and northing coordinates respectively, 
       while `rho` is the apparemt resistivity at each measurement point(`pk`).
       `sloc` is the colum of anomaly boundaries definition. The optionals 
       column's names such as `sloc`, `shape` and  `type` can be nothing.
        
    === ======== =========== ========== ======== ======= ========
    *pk  *x         *y          *rho      sloc     shape  type   
    === ======== =========== ========== ======== ======= ========
    0   790210      1093010     230        low

    20  790218      1093026     93         up
        ...
    140 790255      1093116     138        
    === ======== =========== ========== ======== ======= ========
    
    - `low` means the lower boundary of selected anomaly,  can also be '1'
    - `up` means the uper boundary of selected anomaly , can also be `2` 
    - `se` means the sounding location on the survey. can be `ves` or `0`. 
    - `V` anomaly-shape and can be 'W', 'K', 'U', 'H', 'C' and 'M' 
    - `CP` anomaly type and can be 'CB2P', 'NC' or 'EC'
    
    For further details about anomaly shape and type , please refer to the
    :doc:`watex.core.ERP.get_shape` or :doc:`watex.core.ERP.get_type`
    
    ..note::
        `se` is  presumed   to be location of the selected anomaly 
        position and if ``shape` and `type`not provided, will be get 
        automatically. However  to have full control, we strongly 
        recommend to specify the type and the shape of your selected 
        anomaly on ERP line.
