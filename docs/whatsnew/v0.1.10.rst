--------------------------

This is a  change performed from ``v0.1.10``.

- |Fix| In :meth:`watex.methods.ZC.remove_static_sfift` , the :meth:`watex.externals.z.Z.compute_resistivity_phase` 
  is initialized with the corrected impedance :term:`tensor` Z three dimensioanl array and number of frequency.
