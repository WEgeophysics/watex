v0.2.1 (April 7, 2023)
--------------------------

This is minor changes  in ``v0.2.0``.  

- |Feature| Add smoothing approaches from :mod:`watex.utils.exmath` for dropping or masking noised data in :term:`NSAMT` survey : 

  - :func:`watex.utils.smooth1d` polished the one-dimensional data while  :func:`watex.utils.smoothing` smoothes data along a given axis in 
    two-dimensional arrays. 

  - :func:`watex.utils.rhophi2z` converts impedance-style information given in Rho/Phi format into complex valued Z. It is more consistent 
    compared to :func:`watex.utils.exmath.rhoa2z`

- |Feature| :func:`watex.utils.funcutils.rename_files` gives several approaches for quick renaming/shifting files especially when dealing with :term:`EDI` files. 

- |Feature| Add new methods  in  :class:`watex.site.Profile`   from :mod:`watex.site` as supplement site data io and visualization. 
  
  - :meth:`watex.site.Profile.out` gives many ways for exporting coordinates data points including elevation

  - :meth:`watex.site.Profile.plot` gives a base plot for data visualization.

- |Fix| Bug fixed in :meth:`watex.methods.Processing.ama` computation. Rather than using the raw phase for recomputing the shifted data, it henceforth 
  uses the coefficient factor calculated from the corrected apparent resistivities to recompute the new phase. Then use the new phase for recomputing 
  the impendance tensor `z` in turn when the objective is to output new corrected impedance tensor from parameter ``out`` of :class:`watex.methods.Processing` class. 

- |Enhancement| Improve the :term:`EMAP` filters by adding new parameters  ``drop_outliers`` and ``smooth`` for removing outliers and smoothing data along 
  the frequencies axis using :meth:`watex.methods.Processing.tma` for trimming-moving average, :meth:`watex.methods.Processing.ama` for adaptative moving average based 
  on ideas or Torres-Verdin  and :meth:`watex.methods.Processing.tma` for fixed length dipole-moving average. This efficiently deals with the static shift 
  effect when interferences noises are strong enough.
  
- |Enhancement| Update :meth:`watex.method.ZC.remove_ss_emap`. Henceforth correct tensor data by applying the smoothing 
  approached along the frequencies axis using the ``smooth`` and ``drop_outliers`` parameters.
